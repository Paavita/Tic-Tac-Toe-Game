# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A Tic Tac Toe game in which it is hard to beat the AI, made with minimax algorithm. I made it with the help of freeCodeCamp by following along with their YouTube tutorial. For a better understanding you can head over to their website or YouTube channel to get the source code as well.
This tutorial gave me a better understanding of functions and minimax algorithm. Minimax algorithm is basically a recursive function, you can find more about minimax on FreeCodeCamp website.
